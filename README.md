# Parallel_Ping_Pong

Design two different processes A and B which are running independently on
different computers. First process A will send message to process B and then
B will message back to A. Depending on the timing, communication cost will
estimate. Assume, time needed to send an n-byte message is λ + η/β
where, λ = Latency, β = Bandwidth, η = Byte Message
